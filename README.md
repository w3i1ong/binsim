# BinSim: Binary Code Similarity Detection with Neural Networks

BinSim is a python package for Binary Code Similarity Detection.
It currently implements several neural network models for binary code similarity detection, including:
1. [Gemini](https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.06525)     
2. [SAFE](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.05296)
3. [i2v_rnn and i2v_att](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9797388)
4. [jTrans](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.12713)
5. [alpha-diff](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9000005)
6. [RCFG2Vec]()
7. [Asteria](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.06082)
8. [GMN]()(not fully implemented)
9. [jTrans]()(not fully implemented)

It also implements several language models for binary code, including:

1. [Asm2Vec](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8835340)
2. [PalmTree]()(not implemented)
3. [instruction2Vec]()(not implemented)
4. [ins2vec]()(not implemented)

We provide a simple guideline to reproduce the results in the paper, and you can get it from [here](guideline.md)
